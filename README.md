The Prework Study Guide is designed to help students prepare for their coding bootcamp by providing essential notes on fundamental web development topics. Each section of the guide is dedicated to a specific subject, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. In the HTML section, you'll find information on creating the structure of a web page, while the CSS section covers styling and layout techniques. The JavaScript section includes notes on adding interactivity and dynamic functionality to your web pages. Additionally, the Git section offers guidance on version control and collaborative coding.
